# 🧠 Crypto Vulnerability Pipeline

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project is a full-cycle **data engineering and analytics pipeline** focused on **analyzing smart contract vulnerabilities in the blockchain ecosystem**. It pulls blockchain data, cleans and transforms it, runs correlation and frequency analysis on risk tags, and applies **unsupervised machine learning (clustering)** to discover hidden risk patterns among smart contracts.

# 🧠 Crypto Risk Tag Analysis Pipeline

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project is a full-cycle **data engineering and analytics pipeline** focused on analyzing **smart contract vulnerabilities** in the blockchain ecosystem. It pulls blockchain data, cleans and transforms it, runs **correlation and frequency analysis** on risk tags, and applies **unsupervised machine learning (clustering)** to discover hidden risk patterns among smart contracts.

## 📦 Features

- Fetches up-to-date smart contract data from a Web3/blockchain API
- Stores raw JSON data locally with timestamps
- Loads data into a PostgreSQL database
- Performs detailed **frequency and correlation** analysis of labeled vulnerabilities
- Uses **clustering algorithms** (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar vulnerabilities
- Exports results and visualizations for reporting
- Modular code organized by function (`fetch`, `store`, `analyze`, `visualize`)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **PostgreSQL** (psycopg2)
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning** (Clustering)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**
- **JSON data handling**
- **SQL schema management**

## 🧪 Sample Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fetch and store raw data
python fetch_and_store.py

# 2. Run analysis (frequency, correlation, clustering)
python analyze.py

# 3. Visualize the results
python visualize.py
````

## 🧠 Insights from Analysis

* **Top risk tags** are identified by frequency of occurrence across smart contracts
* **Correlated risk patterns** reveal commonly co-occurring vulnerabilities
* **Clustering** helps uncover hidden groupings based on shared risk profiles

## 📈 Sample Visuals

(Include example plots saved in your `/outputs` folder. For example: frequency bar chart, correlation heatmap, cluster plot.)

## 💡 Future Improvements

* API rate-limit handling & retries
* Dockerize the project for production
* Schedule via Apache Airflow or Prefect
* Integrate alert system for risky contracts
* Push outputs to dashboard (Streamlit / Power BI embedded)
